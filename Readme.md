# Analysis and Forecasting of Coffee Sales Trends, Customer Loyalty, and Discount Impact

This project focuses on a data-driven analysis of **QahwaCo**, a specialty coffee retailing company in Saudi Arabia. Using two years of historical sales data, the project explores seasonal trends, evaluates the effectiveness of discount strategies, and implements forecasting models to optimize inventory management and business growth.
